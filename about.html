                    <p>I'm Renzo, the soul behind Old Soul Thrift. Growing up surrounded by classic fashion and timeless pieces, I learned early on that style isn't just about trends—it's about stories, character, and self-expression.</p>
                    <h3>Why Old Soul Was Made</h3>
                    <p> Old Soul Thrift was born from my passion for vintage clothing and a desire to make sustainable style accessible. I wanted to create a space where every piece has a past, where every customer can find something that feels truly their own. For me, thrift is more than shopping—it's discovering history, embracing individuality, and giving new life to forgotten treasures.</p>
